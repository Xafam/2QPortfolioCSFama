<h1>The King Before the Throne</h1>
<h2> I. The Birth of The King</h2>
<p> LeBron James was born on December 30 1984, in Akron, Ohio. As a kid, Lebron already had a passion for basketball. I think that the exact day his passion ignited was on Christmas day 1987, when his mother got him a basketball hoop for christmas. </p>

<h2> II. The King's First Steps</h2>
<p> Even since elementary school, LeBron was highly regarded as a basketball sensation. In highschool, he led St. Vincent-St. Mary High School's basketball team to three Ohio state championships. He was so great to the point that he was the cover of Sports Illustrated's magazine, which called him "The Chosen One". Finally, in the 2003 NBA draft, he was chosen as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
